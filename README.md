## 🎯 Research Context

**Problem Statement:**  
Organizations face critical challenges implementing Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) due to widespread reliance on legacy systems that lack modern security capabilities. Despite 67% of organizations identifying legacy integration as their primary ZTA barrier, no validated frameworks exist for systematic integration.

**Research Objective:**  
This dataset supports the development of comprehensive guidelines enabling organizations to adopt ZTA principles without complete infrastructure replacement, addressing the $15M+ average cost barrier preventing ZTA adoption.

**Target Use Cases:**
- Legacy system compatibility assessment
- ZTA integration strategy development
- Cost-benefit analysis for security modernization
- Machine learning model training for integration difficulty prediction
- Risk assessment and prioritization frameworks

## 📖 Dataset Description

### Data Collection Methodology

The dataset was **synthetically generated** based on:
- Real-world enterprise architecture patterns documented in academic literature
- Industry survey data on legacy system prevalence (Okta, Gartner, NIST reports)
- Authentication protocol usage statistics from LANL and CICIDS datasets
- Expert knowledge of enterprise security implementations

**Realistic Correlations Implemented:**
- Older systems (>20 years) → Lower ZTA compatibility scores (1-4)
- Banking/Healthcare industries → Stricter compliance requirements (PCI-DSS, HIPAA)
- Systems without APIs → Higher integration difficulty
- Critical systems → Higher replacement costs
- Legacy authentication methods → More security incidents
